Subject: Inquiry about Conference Dinner Venue

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you are well. I am writing to inquire about hosting a conference dinner at your hotel for my company’s 10th anniversary. We expect around 200 guests and would like to begin with drinks and snack food on arrival, followed by a three-course meal with vegetarian and vegan options. We also require round tables seating 10–12 people each, a band and space for dancing, plus a microphone and a good sound system for speeches. Could you please let me know your best price per person? Additionally, do you offer any discounts or package deals for large groups? Thank you in advance for your assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Chris Bumstead,Events Manager
